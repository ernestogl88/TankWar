# Tank-War

## Play game at:

https://ernestogl88.github.io/TankWar/

## Controls: 

You can move the red tank with the arrow keys, and shoot with the space bar.

## Biggest challenges

The hardest thing for me to do, has been the collisions between enemies tanks, in fact some times they enter in a madness spiral when they collide.

The refactor has been a problem in some collisions, the tanks have their collisions in their own class, but when I haven't been capable of to do the same with the bullets. The friday morning I thougt some improves in refactoring but I haven't time to implement it.

## Improves

* Make a two players game.
* Introduce powerups.
* Give life points to obstacles and enemies.
